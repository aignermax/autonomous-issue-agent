# Agent Instructions for Lunima

**NOTE:** This is an example `CLAUDE.md` file configured for **Lunima** (formerly
Connect-A-PIC-Pro; C# / Avalonia / MVVM project).

If you're using the Autonomous Issue Agent for a different project, adapt this file to your tech stack, architecture patterns, and coding standards.

> **Tool paths:** This document references `<TOOLS_PYTHON>` (path to a python with
> openai/python-dotenv installed) and `<TOOLS_DIR>` (where the python-dev-tools
> live). The Autonomous Issue Agent auto-installs them via the upstream
> install.sh into `~/.cap-tools/` and substitutes the real paths into prompts
> at runtime; for human readers, mentally substitute these placeholders.

This repository is maintained with the help of an autonomous AI agent.
Stability, clarity, and architectural discipline are more important than speed.

## CRITICAL: Vertical Slice Requirement

**Every feature implementation MUST be a complete vertical slice.**
Do NOT submit backend-only or core-only code. Every PR must include user-testable UI.

A complete vertical slice includes ALL of these layers:

1. **Core logic** — New classes in `Connect-A-Pic-Core/` (concrete classes are fine, use interfaces only when multiple implementations are needed)
2. **ViewModel** — `ObservableObject` in `CAP.Avalonia/ViewModels/` with `[ObservableProperty]` and `[RelayCommand]`
3. **View / AXAML** — UI panel in `CAP.Avalonia/Views/` or a new section in `MainWindow.axaml`
4. **DI wiring** — Register new services in `CAP.Avalonia/App.axaml.cs` if needed
5. **Unit tests** — xUnit tests in `UnitTests/` for core logic
6. **Integration tests** — Core + ViewModel integration tests in `UnitTests/` (place alongside related unit tests)

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.** The human developer must be able to test the feature in the UI immediately after PR merge.

---

## 1. Architecture Rules

- Follow SOLID principles strictly.
- **Maximum 250 lines per NEW file.** Existing large files (MainViewModel.cs, DesignCanvas.cs) should not be refactored just for line count.
- No God classes — one responsibility per class.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies.
- Use dependency injection where appropriate (constructor injection).
- **Only create interfaces when multiple implementations exist.** Concrete classes are fine otherwise.
- Do not introduce unnecessary abstractions.
- Do not refactor unrelated modules.
- Never modify UI or Routing unless explicitly required by the issue.

When in doubt: choose the simplest correct solution.

---

## 2. Code Structure

- Small, composable classes.
- Methods should generally not exceed ~20 lines.
- No large static utility classes.
- Avoid hidden side effects.
- Favor explicitness over cleverness.
- Keep changes minimal and localized.
- Prefer early returns over nested if/else.
- Max 2-3 levels of nesting.

### Folder Organization

**Keep folders organized and logically structured.**

- **Maximum 8-10 files per folder** before creating subfolders
- Group related classes into meaningful subfolders
- Use clear, descriptive subfolder names that reflect their purpose

**Examples:**

If `CAP.Avalonia/ViewModels/` has many files, organize by feature:
```
CAP.Avalonia/ViewModels/
  Analysis/
    ParameterSweepViewModel.cs
    OptimizationViewModel.cs
  Components/
    ComponentLibraryViewModel.cs
    PdkManagerViewModel.cs
  Layout/
    DesignCanvasViewModel.cs
    RoutingViewModel.cs
```

If `Connect-A-Pic-Core/Components/` grows large:
```
Connect-A-Pic-Core/Components/
  Waveguides/
    WaveguideConnection.cs
    WaveguideRouter.cs
  Couplers/
    GratingCoupler.cs
    DirectionalCoupler.cs
  PDK/
    PdkInfo.cs
    PdkLoader.cs
```

**When adding new features:**
- Check if the target folder already has 8+ files
- If yes, create or use an appropriate subfolder
- Follow existing subfolder patterns in the codebase
- Don't create subfolders with only 1-2 files (wait until there's 3+)

---

## 3. Code Style

- C# naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for public members
  - _camelCase for private fields
  - No abbreviations except well-known ones (VM, DI, etc.)
- Every public class and method must have XML documentation.
- No magic numbers — use named constants.
- Prefer readonly fields and immutable data where possible.
- Use clear, intention-revealing names.

---

## 4. MVVM Pattern (CommunityToolkit.Mvvm)

All ViewModels must:
- Inherit from `ObservableObject`
- Use `[ObservableProperty]` for bindable properties
- Use `[RelayCommand]` for user actions
- Be registered in DI container (`CAP.Avalonia/App.axaml.cs`)

Example:
```csharp
public partial class MyFeatureViewModel : ObservableObject
{
    [ObservableProperty]
    private string _resultText = "";

    [ObservableProperty]
    private bool _isProcessing;

    [RelayCommand]
    private async Task RunAnalysis()
    {
        IsProcessing = true;
        // ... do work
        IsProcessing = false;
    }
}
```

Reference: `CAP.Avalonia/ViewModels/ParameterSweepViewModel.cs`

---

## 5. Views (Avalonia AXAML)

- Use `x:DataType="vm:YourViewModel"` for compiled bindings
- Follow existing MainWindow layout pattern
- New feature panels go in the Right panel (properties area) as collapsible sections
- Use clear visual separators between sections
- Follow Parameter Sweep panel pattern in `MainWindow.axaml` (lines 193-229)

---

## 6. Testing

**CRITICAL:** All features MUST have tests before considering work complete.

### Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for all new core logic classes
- Test file naming: `{ClassName}Tests.cs`
- Use xUnit with `[Fact]` and `[Theory]` attributes
- Shouldly for assertions: `result.ShouldBe(expected)`, `value.ShouldBeGreaterThan(0)`
- Moq for mocking: `new Mock<IService>()`
- Tests must be independent and deterministic
- Cover edge cases and failure scenarios
- Do not remove existing tests unless explicitly required

### Integration Tests (REQUIRED)
**Every feature needs at least one integration test that verifies the full stack:**

```csharp
[Fact]
public void FeatureName_WorksEndToEnd_FromUIToCore()
{
    // Arrange: Create ViewModel with real core service
    var coreService = new MyAnalyzer();
    var vm = new MyFeatureViewModel(coreService);

    // Act: Trigger the user action (as if user clicked button in UI)
    vm.RunAnalysisCommand.Execute(null);

    // Assert: Verify ViewModel state reflects successful operation
    vm.IsProcessing.ShouldBeFalse();
    vm.ResultText.ShouldNotBeNullOrEmpty();
    vm.HasErrors.ShouldBeFalse();
}
```

**Integration tests verify:**
1. ✅ ViewModel commands work correctly
2. ✅ Core logic produces expected results
3. ✅ Results are properly reflected in ViewModel properties (UI-bindable)
4. ✅ Error handling flows through the stack

Reference: `UnitTests/Analysis/ParameterSweeperTests.cs`

### Test-Driven Quality
- Run tests after EVERY code change
- If tests fail, fix immediately — do not continue
- Aim for >80% code coverage on new code
- Tests ARE the specification — they prove it works

---

## 7. Recipe: Adding a New Feature

Follow this checklist for EVERY new feature:

1. **Core class** in `Connect-A-Pic-Core/Analysis/` or appropriate folder (max 250 lines)
2. **ViewModel** in `CAP.Avalonia/ViewModels/MyFeatureViewModel.cs`
   - Inherit `ObservableObject`
   - Use `[ObservableProperty]` and `[RelayCommand]`
3. **Add ViewModel property** to `MainViewModel`:
   ```csharp
   public MyFeatureViewModel MyFeature { get; } = new();
   ```
4. **Add AXAML panel** in `MainWindow.axaml` (right panel section)
5. **Register in DI** if needed (`App.axaml.cs`)
6. **Unit tests** for core class
   - Test all public methods
   - Test edge cases and error handling
   - **Run `dotnet test` and ensure all tests pass**
7. **Integration test** for Core→ViewModel→UI flow
   - Test that ViewModel commands work
   - Test that results appear in ViewModel properties (UI-bindable)
   - **This proves the feature actually works from UI perspective**
   - **Run `dotnet test` again and ensure integration test passes**

**Do not skip ANY of these steps.**

**Work is NOT complete until:**
- ✅ All 7 steps are done
- ✅ `dotnet build` succeeds
- ✅ `dotnet test` passes with ALL tests green
- ✅ Feature is visible and usable in the UI

---

## 8. Build & Verification

Before finishing work:

1. Run `dotnet build`
2. Run `dotnet test`
3. Fix all build errors.
4. Fix all failing tests.
5. Ensure no new warnings are introduced unnecessarily.

**Do not stop until build AND tests pass.**

---

## 9. Git Discipline

- Only modify files related to the issue.
- Keep commits focused and minimal.
- Do not change formatting of unrelated files.
- Do not introduce broad refactoring unless required.
- Do not merge — only prepare changes for review.

---

## 10. Simulation Integrity

The core of this repository is photonic S-Matrix-based simulation.

- Preserve physical plausibility.
- Avoid introducing numerical instability.
- Prefer validation over silent assumptions.
- If uncertain about physics correctness, choose the conservative approach.

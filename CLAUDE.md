# Agent Instructions for Connect-A-PIC-Pro

**NOTE:** This is an example `CLAUDE.md` file configured for **Connect-A-PIC-Pro** (C# / Avalonia / MVVM project).

If you're using the Autonomous Issue Agent for a different project, adapt this file to your tech stack, architecture patterns, and coding standards.

This repository is maintained with the help of an autonomous AI agent.
Stability, clarity, and architectural discipline are more important than speed.

## CRITICAL: Vertical Slice Requirement

**Every feature implementation MUST be a complete vertical slice.**
Do NOT submit backend-only or core-only code. Every PR must include user-testable UI.

A complete vertical slice includes ALL of these layers:

1. **Core logic** — New classes in `Connect-A-Pic-Core/` (concrete classes are fine, use interfaces only when multiple implementations are needed)
2. **ViewModel** — `ObservableObject` in `CAP.Avalonia/ViewModels/` with `[ObservableProperty]` and `[RelayCommand]`
3. **View / AXAML** — UI panel in `CAP.Avalonia/Views/` or a new section in `MainWindow.axaml`
4. **DI wiring** — Register new services in `CAP.Avalonia/App.axaml.cs` if needed
5. **Unit tests** — xUnit tests in `UnitTests/` for core logic
6. **Integration tests** — Core + ViewModel integration tests in `UnitTests/` (place alongside related unit tests)

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.** The human developer must be able to test the feature in the UI immediately after PR merge.

---

## 1. Architecture Rules

- Follow SOLID principles strictly.
- **Maximum 250 lines per NEW file.** Existing large files (MainViewModel.cs, DesignCanvas.cs) should not be refactored just for line count.
- No God classes — one responsibility per class.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies.
- Use dependency injection where appropriate (constructor injection).
- **Only create interfaces when multiple implementations exist.** Concrete classes are fine otherwise.
- Do not introduce unnecessary abstractions.
- Do not refactor unrelated modules.
- Never modify UI or Routing unless explicitly required by the issue.

When in doubt: choose the simplest correct solution.

---

## 2. Code Structure

- Small, composable classes.
- Methods should generally not exceed ~20 lines.
- No large static utility classes.
- Avoid hidden side effects.
- Favor explicitness over cleverness.
- Keep changes minimal and localized.
- Prefer early returns over nested if/else.
- Max 2-3 levels of nesting.

---

## 3. Code Style

- C# naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for public members
  - _camelCase for private fields
  - No abbreviations except well-known ones (VM, DI, etc.)
- Every public class and method must have XML documentation.
- No magic numbers — use named constants.
- Prefer readonly fields and immutable data where possible.
- Use clear, intention-revealing names.

---

## 4. MVVM Pattern (CommunityToolkit.Mvvm)

All ViewModels must:
- Inherit from `ObservableObject`
- Use `[ObservableProperty]` for bindable properties
- Use `[RelayCommand]` for user actions
- Be registered in DI container (`CAP.Avalonia/App.axaml.cs`)

Example:
```csharp
public partial class MyFeatureViewModel : ObservableObject
{
    [ObservableProperty]
    private string _resultText = "";

    [ObservableProperty]
    private bool _isProcessing;

    [RelayCommand]
    private async Task RunAnalysis()
    {
        IsProcessing = true;
        // ... do work
        IsProcessing = false;
    }
}
```

Reference: `CAP.Avalonia/ViewModels/ParameterSweepViewModel.cs`

---

## 5. Views (Avalonia AXAML)

- Use `x:DataType="vm:YourViewModel"` for compiled bindings
- Follow existing MainWindow layout pattern
- New feature panels go in the Right panel (properties area) as collapsible sections
- Use clear visual separators between sections
- Follow Parameter Sweep panel pattern in `MainWindow.axaml` (lines 193-229)

---

## 6. Testing

- Write unit tests for all new logic.
- Test file naming: `{ClassName}Tests.cs`
- Use xUnit with `[Fact]` and `[Theory]` attributes
- Shouldly for assertions: `result.ShouldBe(expected)`, `value.ShouldBeGreaterThan(0)`
- Moq for mocking: `new Mock<IService>()`
- Tests must be independent and deterministic.
- Cover edge cases and failure scenarios.
- Do not remove existing tests unless explicitly required.

**Integration tests** (Core + ViewModel):
```csharp
[Fact]
public void ViewModel_ReflectsCoreAnalysisResults()
{
    var coreService = new MyAnalyzer();
    var vm = new MyFeatureViewModel(coreService);
    vm.RunAnalysisCommand.Execute(null);
    vm.ResultText.ShouldNotBeNullOrEmpty();
}
```

## 7. Recipe: Adding a New Feature

Follow this checklist for EVERY new feature:

1. **Core class** in `Connect-A-Pic-Core/Analysis/` or appropriate folder (max 250 lines)
2. **ViewModel** in `CAP.Avalonia/ViewModels/MyFeatureViewModel.cs`
   - Inherit `ObservableObject`
   - Use `[ObservableProperty]` and `[RelayCommand]`
3. **Add ViewModel property** to `MainViewModel`:
   ```csharp
   public MyFeatureViewModel MyFeature { get; } = new();
   ```
4. **Add AXAML panel** in `MainWindow.axaml` (right panel section)
5. **Register in DI** if needed (`App.axaml.cs`)
6. **Unit tests** for core class
7. **Integration test** for Core→ViewModel flow

**Do not skip ANY of these steps.**

---

## 8. Build & Verification

Before finishing work:

1. Run `dotnet build`
2. Run `dotnet test`
3. Fix all build errors.
4. Fix all failing tests.
5. Ensure no new warnings are introduced unnecessarily.

**Do not stop until build AND tests pass.**

---

## 9. Git Discipline

- Only modify files related to the issue.
- Keep commits focused and minimal.
- Do not change formatting of unrelated files.
- Do not introduce broad refactoring unless required.
- Do not merge — only prepare changes for review.

---

## 10. Simulation Integrity

The core of this repository is photonic S-Matrix-based simulation.

- Preserve physical plausibility.
- Avoid introducing numerical instability.
- Prefer validation over silent assumptions.
- If uncertain about physics correctness, choose the conservative approach.

**The goal is a stable, modular, physically meaningful simulation tool with a complete UI — not a backend-only prototype.**
